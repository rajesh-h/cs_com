Dhokla is a savory steamed light, airy and spongy snack similar to a cake. It is made with besan which is the main ingredient along with some baking powder, which plays an important role in puffing up the dhokla. It is then steamed and then tossed is a mustard seeds tadka.

Use yellow chili powder.\nPreferably use a fine quality of besan which is also called as Bombay besan, if it’s not available then use regular besan.\nRed chili paste made with red chilies, salt and oil.\n\nTips:\nPlease do not use a mixer grinder to blend the besan, use a spoon, whisk or a fork for mixing the dhokla batter.\nWhisking the batter will incorporate lot of air and this will make the dhokla fluffy. Whisking also makes the batter very fluid.\nThe dhokla batter puffs only at two stages once while whisking and second when you add the ENO.\nIf you bake the dhokla then they might dry out, hence cooking in a pan is advisable.\n"}

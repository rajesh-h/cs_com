If you don't have all spice powder, you can also add some nutmeg &amp; cinnamon powder or our very own garam masala.<br/>4. I had a small 5.5\" bundt pan so i used a normal 7\" pan cause the bundt pan is too small to accommodate the cake batter. If you have a 7\" one or bigger, use that! <br/>5.

Check the cake after 20 mins if you are using the same thing.

You can prepare the soya chaaps in advance at this stage.\nDuring the final stage you can use Mayonnaise instead for cream.\n\nTips:\nIf you do not have steel skewers then you can use wooden sticks, and if you are making it in the tava then you would not require any sticks.\nPlace a piece of foil around the gas burner; this will avoid the area from becoming messy.\n","searchTags":["cook tikka in tandoor at home","indian style starters appetizers","punjabi food recipes vegetarian","street style recipes indian"],"totalTime":"2 hrs 30 mins","title":"Tandoori Soya Chaap Tikka – Chaap Sticks Street Style Recipe – CookingShooking","created":1545128643000,"featuredImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cscom-2019.appspot.com/uploads/2018/07/Soya-Chaps.jpg","publish":true,"youtubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IkmXwuCjEI?autoplay=1","author":"Yaman Agarwal","slug":"tandoori-soya-chaap-tikka-chaap-sticks-street-style-recipe-cookingshooking","id":7044,"serves":null}

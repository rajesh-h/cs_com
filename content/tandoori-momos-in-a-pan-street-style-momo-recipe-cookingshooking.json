Do not remove too much water cos this will make your momos dry from the inside.\nFor this particular dish you have to fry the momos as we will be using skewers.\nFor the first method of cooking you can use steamed momos if your wish.\nThe serving salad is made with onions, cabbage and chat masala\n\nTips:\nPlease soak the wooden skewers for 30 minutes in water before using it. This will avoid them from burning.\n","prepTime":"1 hr","recipeIngredients":[{"group":{"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Maida","quantity":"2 cup"},{"ingredient":"Salt","quantity":"to taste"},{"quantity":"as required for kneading a stiff dough","ingredient":"Water"}],"name":"For the dough"}},{"group":{"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Cabbage","quantity":"2 cup grated"},{"quantity":"1/2 cup grated","ingredient":"Onion"},{"ingredient":"Salt","quantity":"1 tsp"},{"ingredient":"Ginger","quantity":"2 inch grated"},{"quantity":"1/2 tsp","ingredient":"Black Pepper"},{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Oil"},{"ingredient":"Oil","quantity":"for deep frying"}],"name":"For the filling"}},{"group":{"ingredients":[{"ingredient":"Sattu / Roasted Besan","quantity":"4 tbsp"},{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Salt"},{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Chat Masala"},{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Kasoori methi"},{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Kashmiri Red Chili Powder"},{"ingredient":"Black Salt","quantity":"1/2  tsp"},{"quantity":"1/2 tsp","ingredient":"Garam Masala"},{"ingredient":"Lemon Juice","quantity":"1 tsp"},{"quantity":"1/3 tsp optional","ingredient":"Red Food Colour"},{"ingredient":"Coriander Leaves","quantity":"1 tbsp finely chopped"},{"quantity":"1 tsp","ingredient":"Ginger Garlic Paste"},{"ingredient":"Dahi / Yogurt","quantity":"4 tbsp"},{"quantity":"3 tbsp optional","ingredient":"Mustard Oil"},{"ingredient":"Charcoal","quantity":"1 piece"},{"ingredient":"Ghee","quantity":"1/2 tsp"},{"quantity":"as required, for momos","ingredient":"Wooden / Metal Skewers"},{"quantity":"as required","ingredient":"Oil"}],"name":"For the marinade "}},{"group":{"name":"For serving","ingredients":[{"quantity":"2-3 small finely chopped","ingredient":"Onion"},{"quantity":"1 tbsp","ingredient":"Coriander Leaves"},{"ingredient":"Lemon Juice","quantity":"1 tsp"},{"ingredient":"Chat Masala","quantity":"1/2 tsp"}]}}],"created":1544712689000,"slug":"tandoori-momos-in-a-pan-street-style-momo-recipe-cookingshooking","recipeSteps":[{"group":{"name":"For the dough","steps":[{"stepImageUrl":"https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Step-1-4-251x300.jpg","text":"In a mixing bowl add maida, salt and water as required to make normal dough.

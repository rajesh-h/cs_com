{"content":"Hey Foodies,<br /><br />Baking a cake or a cupcake is easy, but if you have have Microwave with Convection Mode and the bakes does not come out as expected, this is for you.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake3.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2257 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake3.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"mwcupcake3\" width=\"727\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />In a normal Oven, there are heating rods in top as well as in the bottom which makes the food bake evenly. These days Microwaves come with Convection Mode which is meant for baking.. Convection is nothing but Fan-Forced Baking, which means there is a fan which circulates the air inside the oven. While this is normal in High-end-OTGs, Built in Ovens, Gas Ranges and so on, which makes the baking happen faster and even.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake8.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2262\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake8.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"mwcupcake8\" width=\"1923\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />The scenario is somewhat different in this case, there is only one source of heat, the heating rods are either in top of the Microwave or in the sides.. Which makes the food cook faster from the top/side and slower from beneath, even with the convection/fan forced heating. Yes, this might not happen with each and every Microwave with Convection, but does happen with mine, one more i tested in, and many of you said as well. That the cake i baked in my oven was cooked from top well, but batter was wet inside. Then when i cooked it more, it was overcooked from top.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake4.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2258 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake4.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"mwcupcake4\" width=\"702\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />If you are successfully baking goodies in your MW then, its great!

Try to play around with it and see how it behaves, Some of my foodie friends successfully bake in their MW's Convection Mode without doing anything.. After-all it all depends upon every oven, I received a few requests for it, some also said that cake is baked but undercooked from center and so on, so did this tutorial. If you are successfully baking, no need to do this :)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />That's all for today, Thanks for tuning in!","featuredImage":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake51.jpg?alt=media","title":"Eggless Cupcakes Recipe In Microwave Convection Mode - Eggless Microwave Baking","cookTime":"17 min.","recipeSteps":[{"group":{"name":"","steps":[{"text":"Start by preheating your Microwave Oven in Convection Mode for 10 Minutes at 170 C."},{"text":"Whisk flour,baking soda and baking powder together.

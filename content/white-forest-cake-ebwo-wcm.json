But that does not matter.. In a pastry/cake, what matters for me is the look and the taste! I completed the cake by the thought, a broken cake can always be reassembled! A tip for you, when making this cake, refrigerate this for atleast 4 hrs to prevent the breakage and handle with <del>cake</del> care :P Cakes made with curd are super moist,soft and delicious.. So take care of the sponge that's it, the taste is guaranteed!<br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F12%2F5.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\" wp-image-1042 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F12%2F5.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"5\" width=\"614\" height=\"471\" /></a></p><br /><br /></div><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F12%2F14.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\" wp-image-1040 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F12%2F14.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"1\" width=\"614\" height=\"346\" /></a></p><br />Due to my mishandling, the sponge broke, A Broken Cake can always be assembled!

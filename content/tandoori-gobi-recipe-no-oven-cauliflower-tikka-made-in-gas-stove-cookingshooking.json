Long stalks will ensure that the cauliflower florets are easily cooked.\nWooden skewers are not reusable and cannot take the weight of the gobi. Recommend to use metal skewers they are sturdy and stable to use.\nPlace a piece of foil around the gas burner; this will avoid the area from becoming messy and there is no spillage.\n"}

{"recipeNotes":"1. Coconut Milk : You might be thinking why coconut milk in a *tender* coconut ice cream? Well, I've made it in three ways in past and it does taste great all three ways. This is just the moisture, not the meat part. Meat part was also changed. Those are: (a) Only Tender Coconut Water along with the usual ice cream base. (b) A little bit of Coconut Milk in. (c) this quantity. All three ways it taste good as I said, But (a) seems like something's missing and can be icy(not very creamy), and has a lot of tender coconut water flavor. (b) Better than before, but still needs more of that brought it better that is slight creaminess, balanced mild flavor. (c) I increased the quantity of coconut milk also the tc meat &amp; voila. This is much much better! 2. Sugar. I found the Natural Ice Cream Parlour's Tender Coconut Ice cream was way too sweet for my taste buds, I mean literally. If you wish, you can use more sugar in the ice cream, as I din't made the sweetness as much. As it was that sweet!","prepTime":"15 min.

As soon as we entered, saw a kiddo(4-5 years) asking his mumma for another scoop of TC ice cream and continued.. That was surprising.. And I was the one who got the TC in all 4 of us rest the parlour was empty except he &amp; his parents that time, and he started roaming around me &amp; started poking me :P His mumma said sorry and they left then :P Well, that was sweet, but not as much the ice cream(way too sweet it was :P) Hope his mumma checks this recipe out &amp; churns out this Ice Cream for him :D<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F04%2FTCIcecream31.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4678\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F04%2FTCIcecream31-1024x576.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"TCIcecream3\" width=\"980\" height=\"551\" /></a><br /><br />That's all for today!

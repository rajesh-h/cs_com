You can watch my momo recipe video for the dough recipe. Also the red chili chutney video, both are embedded below. <br/>2. Locals mostly make it with raw veggies, that's why I showed this method this time.<br/>3. The liquid from the veggies is very nutritious &amp; delectable.. You can drink it as it is, I do it all the time I drank all of it, I like it a lot! You can also make thupka, or soup with it.. Or use it as a stock if you wish! <br/>4. My mom has been making momos since like many years, like when I was 3-4 years I have been seeing her making.. In my family everyone loves momos, and so she used to make for us almost every week.. Now-a-days once in a month.. She used to say me, make loyi out of the dough(divide the dough into smaller portions).. I used to enjoy that :D Experienced hands!", "title": "Veg Chili Momos Recipe | Local Nepali Style | Momos Recipe", "publish": true, "cookTime": "20 Minutes", "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkbjfXaruUs"}

Have been getting a lot of requests for Diabetic Friendly recipes.. So, I thought to start with this Sugar free Rasgulla.. Yes, Yes, I used Sugar Free Natura which is nothing but sucralose and having a lot of it isn't a good thing for diabetics. But I believe, having one in once in a looonnngg while doesn't matter much ya? I'm not very much known to diabetics to be true as noone in my family is diabetic.. You can use any Sucralose in this recipe.. And even cut down the sugar to half, that is add 10 grams of Sugar Free Substitute. Without any much delay, let's get on to the recipe.<br /><br /><br />Video time:<br /><br /><br /><br />Text recipe:<br /><br /></div><br /> <a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla2.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1944\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla2.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"SFRasgulla2\" width=\"1229\" height=\"692\" /></a> This is a must for you to try, And I hope you will definitely try :) No compromise on anything, just tastes fantastic!<br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">Thanks for stopping by,</p><br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">CookingShooking is on <a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/CookingShooking\">YouTube</a>, <a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/CookingShooking\">Facebook</a>, <a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"https://cookingshooking.com/cabbage-sambharo/www.Google.com/+CookingshookingIn\">Google+</a>, <a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://twitter.com/CookingShooking\">Twitter</a>!</p>","recipeNotes":"I used Sugar Free Natura which comes in powder form. I DO NOT recommend you to use the sugar free tablets/pellets as they might bring a bitter taste. You can use any sugar free which is sucralose.<br/>If you are thinking to cut down on sugar even more, feel free to add 10grams of it or even less.. But if you divide the sugar free and rasgullas, its less than 1 and a half sachets Per Rasgulla of sugar free that you usually add to your tea/coffee..","featuredImage":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla11.jpg?alt=media","serves":"15 rasgullas"}
